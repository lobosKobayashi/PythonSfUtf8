## What is PythonSf

PythonSf is a script language for mathmatics called from an editor through CUI. PythonSf mostly calculates one-liner expressions which has no if and loop sentences although has if expressions  and comprehensions. So the one-liner executes the each calculation just only succesively. So the one-liners are readable.

A stack of PythonSf one-liners is almost a stack of expression and isn't a stack of program codes. So you wouldn't debug tne PythonSf one-liners in almost cases. You can be focusing just only your mathematical problems.

PythonSf one-liners are independent from other one-liners. So you can easily pile up only treasure one-liners. They are well suited to pile up considerations.
